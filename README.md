# Implementation of data structure using JavaScript
## Stack
A stack works on the principle of LIFO (i.e. Last in first out). For example, a deck of card but drawing a random card is not allowed. Only the top card can be drawn.

## Queue
A queue works on the principle of FIFO (i.e. First in first out). A queue is everywhere, in canteen, at the box office, train station, and so on.

## Simple Linked List
A simple linked list is a connected nodes, where each node contains a data and a reference to the next node. The first node of the list is referred to as "the head". The reference to the next node for the last node (referred to as "the tail") is always null in a simple linked list.

## Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is similar to a simple linked list, except it contains the links to previous nodes as well. A doubly linked list can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
